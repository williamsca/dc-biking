* Introduction

City governments have invested in building out networks of bikeshare stations. These programs are popular, but nevertheless they incur substantial costs.

Prior work has found a positive effect of bikeshare stations on local rents. [TODO]

These papers estimate the effect of connecting a neighborhood to the entire bikeshare network. However, they do not capture a key quantity of interest to the policy maker: the marginal value of an additional station at a particular location. This value consists of both the local effect of connecting the immediate neighborhood to the bikeshare network plus and the global value of a more connections across the city.
